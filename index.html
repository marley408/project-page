    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is considered to be the second-largest living cat species after the tiger. It has pronounced sexual dimorphism; males are larger than females and have prominent manes. The mane of the male lion is the most recognisable feature of the species.</p>
